***** ESD.Epp.RegularPaymentCapture.SpecFlow.Features.CaptureCustomerDebitForFundsTransferFeature.DebitAccountOwnerSelection
Given ESD Epp.RegularPaymentCapture app is loaded with CommSee.v1 theme
-> error: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
And the Payment Details page is loaded
-> No matching step definition found for the step. Use the following code to create one:
        [Given(@"the Payment Details page is loaded")]
        public void GivenThePaymentDetailsPageIsLoaded()
        {
            ScenarioContext.Current.Pending();
        }
 
When I select Customer from DebitAccountOwner drop down list
-> skipped because of previous errors
Then the fields for customer debit is loaded
-> No matching step definition found for the step. Use the following code to create one:
        [Then(@"the fields for customer debit is loaded")]
        public void ThenTheFieldsForCustomerDebitIsLoaded()
        {
            ScenarioContext.Current.Pending();
        }
